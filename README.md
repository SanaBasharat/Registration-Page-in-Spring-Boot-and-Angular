# Registration-Page-in-Spring-Boot-and-Angular
Registration page made using Spring Boot and Angular

In the /angular-app directory, run "ng serve" <br/>
In the /springboot-app directory, run "mvn spring-boot:run"<br/><br/>

Open "http://localhost:4200/" on your browser and you should see a list of users.<br/>
To confirm that the server is working, go to "http://localhost:8080/users" to see if it's returning users in JSON format.<br/>

I'm getting the following error:<br/>
